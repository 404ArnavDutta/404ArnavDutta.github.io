# Security & Privacy Notes

- Do **not** commit secrets (API keys, tokens, .env files).  
- Remove personal data from PDFs (check **File â†’ Properties** metadata).  
- If you must keep sources private, put sensitive repos on **private** and only publish compiled assets here.  
- Add watermarks to public PDFs if reuse worries you.
